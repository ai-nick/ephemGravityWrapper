# ephemGravityWrapper
This is a small module I created that depends that you can use to get the gravitaional pull of a planet on the Earth (core to core) at any time. It depends on py-ephem package to make these calculation so if you do not have py-ephem installed, please visit https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pyephem and install the package. 

The plotting script will not run unless the imported packages are install on your machine.
